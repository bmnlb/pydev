brformat.py
-------------------------
Description:
Parse & extract data from "BR" files.
Create csv file, write header & rows.
-------------------------
Background:
Converting "BR" files to csv's will be the first step
to retiring the format. I created them a long time ago
with readability exclusively for viewing as plaintext.
They are very inconsistent and difficult to parse.
The regex i settled on reflects that - it is
pretty liberal with what it matches.
I plan to create something for the user to interface
with and create new records as csv's. From there,
it should be easy to convert further to a database
or spreadsheet format.
